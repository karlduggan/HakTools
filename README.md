# HakTools

Creating tools for CTFs and pentesting studies. There are great tools out there but wanted to make my own to boost my learning and for a bit of fun aswell :)

## Pass Target
- A simple wordlist generator that takes the know parts of a password and produces all possible options, the resulted posibilities is stored in a wordlist.txt which can then be used to bruteforce your way in.
